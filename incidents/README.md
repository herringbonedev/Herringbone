# Incident

The Incident unit is responsible for managing human-driven security workflows in Herringbone. Incidents represent actionable work created from one or more detections and provide a place for analysts to track status, ownership, investigation notes, and resolution details without altering the underlying event or detection data. This unit intentionally separates machine judgment (detections) from human decision-making and response, allowing incidents to evolve independently while preserving a clear audit trail back to the original evidence.
