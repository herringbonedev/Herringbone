### Summary

Herringbone is a flexible, cloud-native platform for log management and security detection. Inspired by the defensive herringbone formation, it provides layered coverage where each component strengthens the whole: log receivers capture data from any source, the detection engine scans and detects threats directly from MongoDB, enrichment adds AI-driven context, and APIs open everything for integration. Deployable on Kubernetes, serverless, or cloud environments, Herringbone adapts to different needs; from straightforward log management to advanced, intelligence-driven security.
