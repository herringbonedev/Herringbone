## Issues

We use GitHub Issues as our project’s to-do list. They’re not just for bugs; they can also be feature requests, ideas, or general tasks we want to track. By adding labels, milestones, and linking them to pull requests, Issues help us plan work and keep the backlog organized.

We use GitHub labels to keep Issues and Pull Requests organized. Each Issue should have:

- A label describing what part of the system it touches (e.g., "logs api")
- A label describing what kind of work it is (e.g., "enhancement")
- Optionally, a status label (extra context, e.g., “help wanted”)

## Code Review

All changes must go through code review before being merged into main. Each pull request requires at least one reviewer’s approval. Reviews are not just about finding bugs; they’re about maintaining quality, consistency, and readability across the codebase. Please make sure your PR:

- Is scoped and focused (avoid unrelated changes).
- Includes clear commit messages and a descriptive PR title/summary.
- Has tests or validation steps if applicable.
- Aligns with project coding standards and style guidelines.
- Includes documentation or updates to relevant files (README, comments, API docs).

Reviewers are encouraged to provide constructive feedback, ask clarifying questions, and suggest improvements. Authors should respond to all comments, even if only to explain why a suggestion isn’t being implemented. Once feedback has been addressed and at least one approval is granted, the PR can be merged into main.

Pull requests are required to be linked to specific issues.
